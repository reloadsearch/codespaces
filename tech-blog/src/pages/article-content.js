            `First, you'll need to install React. You can do this by creating a new React app with create-react-app. For example:`,
            `npx create-react-app my-app`,
            `(You'll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to easily switch Node versions between different projects.)`,
            `Next, you'll need to install React Router. You can do this by running the following command:`,
            `npm install react-router-dom`,
        ]
